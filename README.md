# A New Approach for Motion Prediction for Autonomous Driving

## Introduction

  In pursuit of advancing road safety, the automotive industry is rapidly evolving, with a particular focus on the development of autonomous vehicles. A paramount challenge in this endeavor is the ability to detect potential hazards and respond proactively to prevent accidents. This necessitates equipping autonomous vehicles with the capability to comprehend their dynamic environment and predict the movements of various traffic participants, including humans, vehicles, and motorcycles.
  
## Brief Analysis
  This repository introduces a novel approach to address this critical aspect of autonomous drivingâ€”vehicle motion prediction. Our methodology leverages a synergistic combination of Kalman Filter, the YOLO library and Clothoids.

  The core objective of this project is to enhance the overall safety of autonomous vehicles by empowering them to make informed decisions based on a nuanced understanding of their surroundings. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we present results from extensive simulated experiments, demonstrating the robustness and efficiency of the proposed solution in predicting the intricate dynamics of traffic scenarios.
